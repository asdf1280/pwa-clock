# pwa-clock

Simple digital clock PWA

## Changes from the original repo

* Light mode. If you don't like this color, fork the project and modify it.
* Timezone conversion support. Double tap the screen to adjust the timezone offset. The timezone offset is stored in localStorage.
* Works better in iOS PWA environment. No black bars in landscape view. No zoom bugs when changing the orientation. No annoying unnecessary scrolls.
* The location of colons won't change even the hour is only one digit long.
